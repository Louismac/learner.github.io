# Maximilian.js Self Hosted Libraries

If you want to run [maximilian.js](https://mimicproject.com/guides/maximJS) on sometihng other than the mimicproject.com website

To do thus, you will need to access the libraries.

* ``maximilian.v.0.1.js``

* ``index.mjs``

* ``ringbuf.js``

* ``maxi-processor.js``

There are some specfic headers related to [SharedArrayBuffers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer#security_requirements) that mean this will only work under certain circumstances. We give examples of either running this fully locally serving the files yourself, or using the versions hosted on mimicproject.com

## Running on GitHub Pages

You can see a demo of this repository running [here](https://louismac.github.io/maximilian-js-local/)

Include the libraries, and also the ``enable-threads.js`` file (this injects in some headers and is neccessary to get this to work when you are not in control of how the page is served)

``<script crossorigin src = "./maximilian.v.0.1.js"></script>``
``<script crossorigin src = "./enable-threads.js"></script>``

Tell ``maximilian.js`` where to find libraries

```
let maxi;
initAudioEngine("https://louismac.github.io/maximilian-js-local").then((dspEngine)=>{
  maxi = dspEngine;
  //Get audio code from script element
  maxi.setAudioCode("myAudioScript");
})
```

##Â Running Locally

To run on your local machine 

### Use libraries hosted on mimicproject.com

If you have access to the internet whilst running libraries, this may be the best option.

Include the libraries

``<script crossorigin src = "https://mimicproject.com/libs/maximilian.v.0.1.js"></script>``

Tell ``maximilian.js`` where to find libraries

```
let maxi;
initAudioEngine("https://mimicproject.com/libs").then((dspEngine)=>{
  maxi = dspEngine;
  //Get audio code from script element
  maxi.setAudioCode("myAudioScript");
})
```

You can change the urls appropriately if you are hosting elsewhere

## Locally hosted library

The recommended way to do this is to use the python server we have provided (server.py).

Then when in the project folder in the terminal run the command below.

``python server.py``

This serves the files in the folder at ``http://localhost:4200`` and adds a header to get around CORS issues.

Include the libraries

``<script crossorigin src = "./maximilian.v.0.1.js"></script>``

Tell ``maximilian.js`` where to find libraries

```
let maxi;
initAudioEngine("http://localhost:4200").then((dspEngine)=>{
  maxi = dspEngine;
  //Get audio code from script element
  maxi.setAudioCode("myAudioScript");
})
```

## Run demo locally!

Download this repo. Then when in the project folder in the terminal run the command below.

``python server.py``

Then all you need to do is visit ``http://localhost:4200`` to see the demo running
